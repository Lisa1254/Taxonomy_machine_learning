# Taxonomy_machine_learning

Assignment for Software Tools for Biological Data at University of Guelph.  
Purpose of script is to build a classifier that will be able to distinguish at the genus level between two genera of the Muridae family of the Rodentia order. This script uses the rentrez package to access NCBI's nuccore database and acquires sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (CytB) for Apodemus and Niviventer, which was analysed with a variety of packages, including randomForest to generate the supervised machine learning model. After refining the model to a suitable level of accuracy (target accuracy greater than 99%), sequences that were misclassified were explored to understand the discrepancy between the label and the prediction.  
Final assignment submission also uploaded for demonstration of figures produced and accompanying analysis.
